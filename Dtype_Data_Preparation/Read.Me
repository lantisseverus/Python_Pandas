# Background - From DataCamp

A common problem when creating models to generate business value from data is that the datasets can be so large that it can take days for the model to generate predictions. 
Ensuring that your dataset is stored as efficiently as possible is crucial for allowing these models to run on a more reasonable timescale without having to reduce the size of the dataset.

## Point to learn
- Different Data Types.
- Categorical variables can save memory if assigned properly.
